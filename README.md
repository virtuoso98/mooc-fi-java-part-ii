# MOOC Java Programming II (University of Helsinki)
 
## üõ†Ô∏è Motivation
On a more regular summer, I'd have engaged in some sort of side project or continued doing leetcode. However, my next internship uses **Java** and **Kotlin**, among other things. Therefore, I saw this as a good chance to pick up a new language from scratch. 

Previously, I've been coding mainly in Typescript and Python. I haven't touch a compiled language like Java before. In order to make my knowledge of Java more well-rounded, I decided to take this course in order to solidify my fundamentals.

## ‚ùì Use
Please use this repository freely if you need help in any coding questions inn this particular module. This MOOC is basically a self-directed MOOC that drills you with roughly 200-300 exercises in total. At the end of it, I improved signficantly in Java. Would really recommend to those who really need to spend some time getting used to a compiled language like Java!
